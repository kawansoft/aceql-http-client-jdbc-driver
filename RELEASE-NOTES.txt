
                 AceQL Client JDBC Driver
                     Release Notes

Introduction
------------

The AceQL Java Client JDBC Driver allows to wrap the AceQL HTTP APIs and 
eliminate the tedious works of handling communications errors and 
parsing JSON results.

Android and Java Desktop application developers can access 
remote SQL databases and/or SQL databases in the cloud by simply 
including standard JDBC calls in their code, just like 
they would for a local database.

The AceQL Client JDBC Driver is licensed under the Apache 2.0
License.

---------------------------------------------------

Whats New:
- AceQLConnection.getServerVersionNumber() has been suppressed and
  getting the server version must be done using only 
  AceQLConnection.getServerVersion() which returns a string.
  This has been done because comparing versions would fail with a server
  version with alphanumeric value as in "6.0b".
  

AceQL Java Client SDK - Version 5.0 - 21-Sep-2020
-------------------------------------------------

What's New:
- Connection.getSchema() has been added.
- Statement.execute() & PreparedStatement.execute() have been added.

  implemented (for access via the AceQL JDBC Driver only).

  required by the JDBC specifications.

  and to follow industry best standards.


AceQL Java Client SDK - Version 4.1 - 01-Jun-2020
-------------------------------------------------
 
What's New:
  - AceQL allows now client supplementary authentication without a password
    using directly an existing AceQL Session ID.
    This has been asked by our users, because some working environments
    (Intranet, etc.) may require that the client user authenticates himself 
    without a password. 
  - This version requires Java 8+.
    

AceQL Java Client SDK - Version 4.0.2 - 07-Apr-2020
---------------------------------------------------

What's New:
- The AceQLConnection.setPrettyPrinting(boolean prettyPrinting)
  method has been removed, as the server requires JSON 
  pretty printing to always be on in order to avoid hazardous 
  line splitting.   

Bugs fixed:
- null values were not correctly supported when using the
  following methods: PreparedStatement.setBigDecimal, 
  PreparedStatement.setDate, PreparedStatement.setTime, 
  PreparedStatement.setTimestamp and PreparedStatement.setURL.
  This has been fixed.
    

AceQL Java Client SDK - Version 4.0.1 - 17-Jan-2020
---------------------------------------------------

What's New:
- The new metadata API allows downloading a remote database schema
  in HTML or text format, to get a remote database main properties, 
  to get the list of tables, and to get the details of each table. 
  It also allows wrapping remote tables, columns, indexes, etc into
  easy to use provided Java classes: Table, Index, Column, etc.
  The metadata API allows exposing more easily the databases along with the 
  schemas, without any need to communicate or synchronize separated  
  documentation for the API users. Users are thus autonomous to explore 
  the metadata and schema of the exposed databases. 
  
  
AceQL Java Client SDK - Version 3.0.1 - 16-Sep-2019
---------------------------------------------------

Bugs fixed:
